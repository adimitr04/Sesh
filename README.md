# Sesh
## Project overview:

**Sesh** is a *concept* fitness/health planner application. 

The app, in its core, provides the user with an in-depth and flexible way to assemble and manage work-out plans, schedules and goals, which can all be 
further integrated into a proper **program**. This allows the average person to form and systemize their fitness and health journey.

**Prototype demo** [here.](https://cloud.protopie.io/p/f32371a789?ui=false&mockup=true&touchHint=false&scaleToFit=true&cursorType=touch)
